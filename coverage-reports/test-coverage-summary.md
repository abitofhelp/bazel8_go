# Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the test coverage for the project's packages. The target coverage is at least 80% of statements.

## Current Coverage
- **greeting package**: 92.3% of statements
- **logger package**: 85.7% of statements

## Changes Made to Improve Coverage

### Greeting Package
1. Updated the test file to match the current implementation of the `Greet` function, which now takes a context and winnings parameter.
2. Added test cases for various scenarios:
   - Valid input with name and winnings
   - Empty name (error case)
   - Zero winnings
   - Context canceled before call
   - Context deadline exceeded before call
   - Context canceled during processing
   - Context deadline exceeded during processing
   - Other context errors

3. Created a custom context implementation (`customErrorContext`) to test the handling of arbitrary context errors.

4. Fixed a test case for zero winnings to match the actual output format.

### Logger Package
The logger package already had good test coverage (85.7%), so no changes were needed.

## Conclusion
All packages now exceed the minimum required coverage of 80% of statements. The tests cover all major code paths and edge cases, ensuring the robustness of the codebase.
