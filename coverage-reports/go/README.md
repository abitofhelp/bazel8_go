# Go Coverage Reports

This directory contains code coverage reports generated by Go's built-in testing tools.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML coverage report that can be viewed in a web browser

## Generating Reports

Go coverage reports are automatically generated when running:

```bash
make test-coverage
```

## Viewing Reports

To view the HTML coverage report:

```bash
open coverage-reports/go/index.html
```

The HTML report provides a visual representation of which lines of code are covered by tests, with color-coding to indicate covered and uncovered lines.
